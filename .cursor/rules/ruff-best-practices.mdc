- Configure Ruff to use a consistent line length (e.g., 88 as per your settings)
- Use Ruff's auto-fix capabilities with `ruff --fix`
- Leverage Ruff's specific rules (RUF) for Python best practices
- Integrate Ruff into your CI/CD pipeline for automated code quality checks
- Use per-file ignores for test-specific rules to avoid false positives
