- Use NumPy's universal functions (ufuncs) for element-wise operations
- Employ broadcasting for efficient array operations
- Utilize `np.where` for conditional operations instead of loops
- Use `np.array` with appropriate `dtype` for memory-efficient arrays
- Implement proper array slicing techniques for data manipulation
